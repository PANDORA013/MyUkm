## üñ•Ô∏è Starting Real-time Features

### Option 1: Universal Launcher (Recommended)
```bash
# Run the universal launcher
start.bat

# Then select:
# [4] Realtime Development (Laravel + Queue + Vite)
# [7] Laravel + Queue Worker (Chat Ready)  
# [8] Complete Realtime Stack (All Services)
```

### Option 2: Quick Scripts
```bash
# Complete real-time setup
launch-myukm.bat

# Instant launch with real-time
instant-launch.bat

# Real-time development mode
start-realtime-dev.bat
```

## üîß Services Required for Real-time Features

For real-time chat and notifications to work, you need these services running:

1. **Laravel Server** (`php artisan serve`)
2. **Queue Worker** (`php artisan queue:work`)
3. **Vite Dev Server** (optional, for hot reload)

## ‚ö° Optimized Queue Configuration

The queue system is configured for optimal real-time performance:

- **Priority queues**: `realtime` queue processed before `default`
- **Fast timeouts**: 90 seconds max processing time
- **Auto-retry**: Failed jobs retry up to 3 times
- **Verbose logging**: Real-time monitoring of queue processing

### Queue Commands Used:
```bash
# High-performance queue worker
php artisan queue:work --queue=realtime,default --verbose --tries=3 --timeout=90

# Background queue processing
php artisan queue:work --verbose --tries=3 --timeout=90
```

## üß™ Testing Real-time Features

### Test Scripts Available:
- `scripts/test/test-realtime-complete.php` - Complete real-time testing
- `scripts/test/test-realtime-responsiveness.bat` - Response time testing
- `scripts/test/test-broadcast-optimization.bat` - Broadcasting performance

### Manual Testing:
1. Start real-time services: `start.bat` ‚Üí Option 7 or 8
2. Open multiple browser tabs to http://localhost:8000
3. Login as different users
4. Test chat functionality and notifications
5. Verify messages appear instantly across all tabs

## üîç Monitoring Real-time Performance

The system includes built-in monitoring for:
- Queue job processing times
- Failed job tracking
- Real-time broadcast success rates
- User connection status

## üìã Troubleshooting

### Chat not working?
1. Ensure queue worker is running: Check for "Queue Worker" window
2. Check Laravel logs: `storage/logs/laravel.log`
3. Verify queue configuration: `config/queue.php`

### Slow performance?
1. Use the optimized queue settings
2. Run performance tests: `scripts/test/test-realtime-performance.php`
3. Monitor queue processing with verbose output

### Connection issues?
1. Verify Laravel server is running on port 8000
2. Check firewall settings
3. Ensure all services started correctly

## üéØ Best Practices

1. **Always use Option 7 or 8** from the launcher for real-time features
2. **Keep queue worker running** for chat and notifications
3. **Monitor queue jobs** during development
4. **Test with multiple users** to verify real-time functionality
5. **Use verbose logging** to debug issues

## üöÄ Production Deployment

For production deployment of real-time features:

1. Configure proper queue driver (Redis recommended)
2. Use queue worker supervisor for auto-restart
3. Set up proper broadcasting driver (Pusher, Redis, etc.)
4. Monitor queue performance and failures
5. Implement proper error handling and logging
