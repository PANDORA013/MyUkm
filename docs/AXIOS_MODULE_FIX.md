# Axios Module Resolution Error - FIXED ✅

## Problem
The application was showing this error in the browser console:
```
Uncaught TypeError: Failed to resolve module specifier "axios". 
Relative references must start with either "/", "./", or "../".
```

## Root Cause
The issue was in the Vite configuration. The `vite.config.js` file had:
```javascript
rollupOptions: {
    external: ['axios'],  // This was the problem!
}
```

This meant that Vite was excluding axios from the bundle, but the JavaScript files were still trying to import it as an ES6 module, causing the module resolution error.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed Vite Configuration ✅
**File**: `config/build/vite.config.js`
- **Removed**: `external: ['axios']` from rollupOptions
- **Result**: Axios is now properly bundled with the application

### 2. Rebuilt Frontend Assets ✅
**Command**: `npm run build`
- **Result**: Generated new bundled files with axios included:
  - `public/build/assets/app-D5_6gsYR.js` (168.53 kB with axios bundled)

### 3. Removed CDN Axios ✅
**File**: `resources/views/chat.blade.php`
- **Removed**: `<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/axios@1.6.0/dist/axios.min.js"></script>`
- **Result**: Using bundled axios instead of CDN to avoid conflicts

### 4. Updated Launch Script ✅
**File**: `launch-myukm.bat`
- **Added**: Frontend build step (Step 3/7)
- **Result**: Assets are always rebuilt during launch

## Technical Details

### Before Fix
```javascript
// vite.config.js - PROBLEMATIC
rollupOptions: {
    external: ['axios'],  // Excluded from bundle
}

// But bootstrap.js was trying to import it
import axios from 'axios';  // Module not found error!
```

### After Fix
```javascript
// vite.config.js - FIXED
rollupOptions: {
    // axios is now bundled normally
}

// bootstrap.js can now import it successfully
import axios from 'axios';  // ✅ Works perfectly!
```

## Verification Steps

1. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   .\launch-myukm.bat
   ```

2. **Open browser to http://localhost:8000**

3. **Check Developer Console (F12)**:
   - ✅ No "Failed to resolve module specifier 'axios'" errors
   - ✅ No JavaScript module errors
   - ✅ Axios is available globally as `window.axios`

4. **Test chat functionality**:
   - ✅ Messages send successfully
   - ✅ Real-time updates work
   - ✅ No AJAX errors

## Files Modified

### Configuration Files
- `config/build/vite.config.js` - Removed axios from external dependencies
- `launch-myukm.bat` - Added frontend build step

### View Files  
- `resources/views/chat.blade.php` - Removed CDN axios script

### Generated Files
- `public/build/assets/app-*.js` - New bundled file with axios included
- `public/build/manifest.json` - Updated asset manifest

## Impact

- ✅ **Fixed**: Axios module resolution errors
- ✅ **Improved**: Consistent dependency management (all via npm)
- ✅ **Enhanced**: Build process now includes frontend compilation
- ✅ **Maintained**: All existing functionality works as before

## Future Prevention

To prevent this issue in the future:
1. Always run `npm run build` after changing dependencies
2. Avoid mixing CDN and bundled versions of the same library
3. Test in browser console after any frontend changes
4. Use the launch script which includes the build step

## Status: ✅ RESOLVED

**The axios module resolution error has been completely fixed. The application now works without any JavaScript module errors.**

**Test Command**: `.\test-axios-fix.bat`
