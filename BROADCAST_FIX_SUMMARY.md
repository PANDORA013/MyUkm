# GitHub Actions Laravel Tests Fix

## Issue Summary
The GitHub Actions workflow was failing during the `composer install` step specifically during the `post-autoload-dump` script execution. The error occurred in `BroadcastManager.php` line 350 where a null value was passed instead of a valid broadcast driver name.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the `BROADCAST_DRIVER` environment variable being set to `pusher` (from .env.example) but without proper Pusher configuration in the CI environment, causing Laravel to receive null when trying to resolve the broadcast connection.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated `.github/workflows/laravel.yml`
✅ **Created/Updated GitHub Actions workflow** with proper environment configuration:
- Added explicit `BROADCAST_DRIVER=log` setting for CI environment
- Added other safe defaults for testing: `MAIL_MAILER=log`, `QUEUE_CONNECTION=sync`, etc.
- Configured MySQL service for database testing
- Added proper PHP extensions including GD
- Added comprehensive steps for environment setup, migrations, and testing

### 2. Updated `.env.example` 
✅ **Changed default broadcast driver** from `pusher` to `log`:
- This prevents issues when developers copy .env.example without setting up Pusher
- `log` driver is safe and doesn't require external services

### 3. Updated `config/broadcasting.php`
✅ **Changed default fallback** from `pusher` to `log`:
- Provides a safer default when `BROADCAST_DRIVER` is not set
- Ensures the application can start even without broadcast configuration

## Verification
- ✅ `composer run-script post-autoload-dump` now works locally
- ✅ `php artisan package:discover` executes successfully
- ✅ All Laravel artisan commands work without broadcast driver errors

## Expected CI/CD Result
The GitHub Actions workflow should now:
1. ✅ Successfully run `composer install` without broadcast driver errors
2. ✅ Complete the `post-autoload-dump` script execution
3. ✅ Proceed to run database migrations and tests
4. ✅ Execute the full test suite

## Files Modified
- `.github/workflows/laravel.yml` - Complete workflow configuration
- `.env.example` - Changed BROADCAST_DRIVER from pusher to log  
- `config/broadcasting.php` - Changed default fallback from pusher to log

## Next Steps
1. Commit and push these changes to trigger the GitHub Actions workflow
2. Monitor the workflow execution to confirm the broadcast driver error is resolved
3. Address any remaining test failures that may surface after this fix

The broadcast driver configuration issue should now be completely resolved for both local development and CI/CD environments.
